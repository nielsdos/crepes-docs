Every event or course consists of 1 or more session groups, and each session group has 1 or more sessions.
A session represents one activity within the event or within the course.
These sessions can be organised at different times and places.
If you do not wish to make such a distinction, you can leave your event at a single session.

Session groups are used to split an event or course into different groups. The sessions are still the same content-wise, but may be organised in different times and places than the sessions in other groups. Splitting into groups effectively allows to organise the same event multiple times.
Again, if you do not wish to utilise this, you can keep the amount of session groups to the default of one group.
