  What does your user need to know to try your project?

Crepes is a self-hosted website that allows you to offer events to users in which they can register themselves.
Think of it like a content-management system, but for events.
It was originally designed to organise in-real-life courses, but has since been transitioning to a more general purpose event management system.
It is still early days for the project, but it is stable enough that it can be used in production.

This chapter guides you through the installation and configuration process.
